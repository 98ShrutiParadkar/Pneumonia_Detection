# Pneumonia Detection (Chest X-Ray Images)

Pneumonia is a life-threatening infectious disease affecting one or both lungs in human being commonly caused by bacteria. Chest X-Rays which are used to diagnose pneumonia need expert radiotherapists for evaluation. Thus, developing an automatic system for detecting pneumonia would be beneficial for treating the disease without any delay particularly in remote areas. Due to the success of deep learning algorithms in analyzing medical images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained much attention for disease classification. In addition, features learned by pre-trained CNN models on large-scale datasets are much
useful in image classification tasks.

In this work, we appraise the functionality of pre-trained CNN models utilized as feature extractors followed by different classifiers for the classification of abnormal and normal chest XRays. We analytically determine the optimal CNN model for
the purpose

## Scope of the Solution
This solution can be used to develop a pneumonia detection system that can help clinicians make accurate and timely diagnosis. The system can analyze medical images such as chest X-rays or CT scans and detect the presence of pneumonia based on the patterns and features in the images. The system can also be trained on large datasets of medical records to identify the risk factors and symptoms associated with pneumonia, which can help clinicians make
better-informed decisions.

## Implications 
One of the key benefits of our solution using CNN Model, Transfer Learning Model (RESNET50, VGGNet16, InceptionV2), RCNN, UNET for pneumonia detection is that it can improve the accuracy and speed of diagnoses, which can lead to better patient outcomes.
Additionally, it can help identify cases of pneumonia that may be missed by human clinicians, particularly in cases where the condition is not yet advanced or the clinician is inexperienced.

To develop a reliable deep learning based pneumonia detection system, it is important to use high-quality medical images and large datasets of medical records. The system should also be
validated using independent datasets to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. In terms of confidence level, the system should be validated to achieve a high sensitivity and specificity to
minimize false positives and false negatives.

In addition to developing an ML based pneumonia detection system, it is important to have appropriate protocols and guidelines in place to ensure the system is used effectively and
safely in clinical settings. Clinicians should also be trained to use the system correctly and interpret its results appropriately. However, careful consideration should be given to the
design, training, and validation of deep learning models to ensure their safety and effectiveness in clinical settings.




## Limitations 
- Large volumes of data are necessary for deep learning. Additionally, the more accurate and powerful models will need more parameters, which calls for more data.
- Deep learning models are rigid and incapable of multitasking after they have been trained. Only one unique problem can they effectively and precisely solve. Even resolving a comparable issue would need system retraining.
- Even with vast amounts of data, existing deep learning approaches cannot handle any application that needs thinking, like programming or using the scientific method. They are also utterly incapable of long-term planning and algorithmic-like data manipulation.
- Biases are another significant concern with deep learning algorithms. When a model is trained on biased data, it will replicate similar biases in its predictions. Deep learning programmers have struggled with this issue since models learn to distinguish based on minute differences in data pieces.


### Where does model fall short in the real world?

CNN Model in pneumonia detection is their potential for false positives and false negatives. CNN models can sometimes mistake other lung conditions or artifacts in the images for pneumonia or fail to detect pneumonia in some cases. This can lead to incorrect diagnoses or missed diagnoses, which can have serious consequences for patients. It can be computationally intensive and require high-performance computing resources, which may not be readily available in some clinical settings. This can limit the practicality and scalability of CNN models for pneumonia detection in real-world settings.

In the RCNN Model, RCNNs are their computational complexity. The multiple stages of the RCNN pipeline, including the region proposal network, convolutional layers, and pooling layers, can be computationally intensive and require high-performance hardware. This can limit the practicality and scalability of RCNN models in clinical settings where resources are limited.

Transfer Learning models can be computationally intensive, especially when fine-tuning is used to adapt the pre-trained model to the pneumonia detection task. Fine-tuning requires re-training the last layers of the pre-trained model on the pneumonia detection dataset, which can be computationally expensive and may require high-performance hardware.

Finally, transfer learning models can be difficult to interpret, which can limit their usefulness in clinical decision-making. It may not always be clear why certain features were selected or how
the model arrived at its decision. Deep Learning models can be prone to overfitting, especially when the dataset size is small or
unbalanced. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to memorize the training data rather than learning the underlying patterns and features. This can lead to poor generalization performance on new data and reduced accuracy in the real world.

In conclusion, deep learning models have shown great potential in pneumonia detection, but they also have limitations such as the need for large amounts of labeled data, potential for overfitting, computational complexity, difficulty in interpretation, and lack of explainability. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to carefully design and validate deep learning models, develop robust and reliable clinical workflows for their deployment in real-world clinical settings, and explore new methods for model explainability and interpretability.
